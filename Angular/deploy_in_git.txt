Deploy to GitHub pages
Another simple way to deploy your Angular app is to use GitHub Pages.

You need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one, and then create a repository for your project. Make a note of the user name and project name in GitHub.

Build your project using Github project name, with the Angular CLI command ng build and the options shown here:

content_copy
ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /<project_name>/
When the build is complete, make a copy of docs/index.html and name it docs/404.html.

Commit your changes and push.

On the GitHub project page, configure it to publish from the docs folder.

You can see your deployed page at https://<user_name>.github.io/<project_name>/.
